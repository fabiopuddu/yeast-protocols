#### Fixation of GFP-tagged proteins

##### Materials
* Fixing Solution (4% paraformaldehyde, 3.4% sucrose)
* Wash Solution (100 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.5, 1.2 M sorbitol)

--

##### Method
* Spin down 1 ml of cells at a density of 5⋅10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in a 1.5 ml tube and remove the supernatant
* Resuspend in 500 µl of Fixing Solution and vortex
* Incubate at room temperature for 15’
* Spin down cells and remove supernatant
* Wash once with 1 ml of Wash Solution
* Resuspend in 250 µl of Wash Solution
*At this point it is possible to store the cells at 4ºC for 2-3 weeks*
* Briefly sonicate cells just before the observation (~1-2 min in waterbath);
