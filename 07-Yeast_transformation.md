##### Method
* Start from exponentially growing cells at a concentration of 5⋅10<sup>6</sup>: 10 ml for each transformation reaction;
* Prepare the required amount of tMIX
* Pellet 50 ml (=for 5 transformations) of cells 4' in a 50 ml tube at 4000 rpm at room temperature;
* Wash the cells with 25 ml of sterile water;
* Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of sterile water and transfer to 2 ml tubes;
* Spin and resuspend in 500 μl (100 μl for each transformation);
* For each transformation, transfer 100 μl of cell suspension in a new 1.5 ml tube, ;
* Spin and discard the supernatant;
* Add 360 μl of Tmix (freshly prepared);
* Add DNA:
  * 200-500 ng for plasmids (1-4 μl of a mini prep);
  * 2-3 μg for deletion/tag cassette (5-10 μl of precipitated PCRs);
* Resuspend the cells using a vortex;
* Incubate at 42°C:
  * 5'-10' for plasmids;
  * 20-25' for multiple plasmid transformations;
  * 40' for transformations that requires a recombination event (e.g. cassettes, gap repair);
* Pellet the cells at 4000 rpm for 1' and discard the supernatant;
* If the transformation involves an autotrophy marker:
  * Wash the cells with with 1 ml of sterile water;
  * Resuspend in 200 μl and plate on selection plates;
* If the transformation involves an antibiotic resistance marker:
  * Resuspend the cells in 1 ml of YPD medium and leave for 1-2 hours at 28°C with agitation;
  * Pellet the cells;
  * Resuspend in 200 μl and plate on selection plates.
