#### Yeast Protein extracts in TCA
This protocols allows for protein extraction in denaturing conditions, 
therby it is best used to preserve the post translational modifications of proteins

##### Materials:
* 20% TCA  (Trichloroacetic Acid)
* 5% TCA
* 6X protein Blue
* Acid-washed glass beads (400-600 μm)
* 2M Tris-Base
* 1.5 and 2 ml Eppendorf tubes

##### Method:
  * Start from ~10 ml of an exponentially growing culture at a concentration of ~8⋅10<sup>6</sup> cell/ml or equivalent
  * Spin down the cells 2 minutes @ 4000 rpm in 50 ml tubes
  * Resuspend the pellets in 1 ml of 20% TCA
  * Transfer in 2 ml tubes
  * Wash the pellets with another ml of 20% TCA
  * Spin down at maximum speed for 1′ and discard the supernatant
  * Resuspend in 50 μl of 20%TCA, vortex
  * Add glass beads up to the meniscus using a measuring spoon
  * Vortex in parallel 4’- 5′
  * Add 100 μl 5% TCA and mix by vortexing
  * Transfer the protein suspension to a new 1.5 ml tube using a p200
  * Centrifuge 10′ at 3000 rpm
  * Discard the supernatant (*aspire with a vacuum pump*)
  * Add 100 μl of 2X PROTEIN BLUE (diluted from the 6X stock), the solution turns yellow
  * Resuspend the pellet by thorough vortexing
  * Add 50 μl of 2M Tris Base to neutralise the pH. Make sure the solution turns blue
  * Boil 3’ a 95°C
  * Centrifuge at max speed for 2’
  * Transfer the superrnatant to a new 1.5 ml tube
  * Store at -20°C for up to two weeks, -80°C for longer term storage
